​🐉 DrakeUI Framework
​The Gold Standard for Roblox Interface Design
​DrakeUI is a premium, high-performance interface framework engineered for developers who refuse to compromise on speed, style, or stability. While other libraries are just "eye candy," DrakeUI is built with a Core-First Philosophy, ensuring your menus remain lightweight, ultra-responsive, and optimized for high-intensity environments.
​Whether you're crafting a complex utility suite, a professional developer tool, or an advanced administrative panel, DrakeUI provides the modular power to move from concept to deployment in minutes, not hours.
​🛡️ Why Choose DrakeUI?
​🚀 Performance Optimized: Engineered with a centralized connection manager to guarantee zero memory leaks and negligible frame-time impact.
​🔐 Encrypted Security: Protect user data with a built-in Base64 encryption layer for secure, tamper-resistant configuration saving.
​📱 Universal Adaptive Scaling: Our custom Responsive Engine ensures your UI looks pixel-perfect on everything from 4K ultrawide monitors to compact mobile screens.
​🛠️ Developer-Centric API: A logic-first programmatic interface that stays out of your way, allowing you to focus on functionality while we handle the aesthetics.
​✨ Smart-Tweening V2: Experience "buttery-smooth" interactions powered by an intelligent animation engine that eliminates UI stutter.
​🎨 Live Theme Engine: Dynamically switch between Dark, Light, and Neon presets—or create your own—without needing to restart the script.
​🎨 Design Philosophy
​DrakeUI follows a Minimalist-Industrial aesthetic. By combining deep-space backgrounds with high-contrast accent borders and subtle drop-shadows, we create a professional, depth-heavy look that commands authority without distracting the user from the game.
