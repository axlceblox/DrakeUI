📖 About DrakeUI
​DrakeUI is a premium interface framework designed for Roblox developers who demand speed, style, and stability. While most UI libraries focus only on looks, DrakeUI is built with a "Core-First" philosophy, ensuring that your menus are not only beautiful but also lightweight and optimized for performance.
​Whether you are building a complex cheat menu, a developer tool, or an in-game administrative panel, DrakeUI provides the modular components you need to get the job done in minutes instead of hours.
​🛡️ Why Choose DrakeUI?
​Performance Optimized: Uses a centralized connection manager to ensure zero memory leaks and minimal frame-time impact.
​Encrypted Security: Includes a built-in Base64 encryption layer for saving sensitive configurations.
​Adaptive Scaling: Features a custom "Responsive Engine" that automatically adjusts UI elements for 4K monitors down to mobile devices.
​Developer Friendly: A clean, programmatic API that stays out of your way and lets you focus on your script's logic.
​Fluid Animations: Powered by a Smart-Tweening engine for that "buttery smooth" feel.
​🎨 Design Philosophy
​DrakeUI follows a Minimalist-Industrial aesthetic. It utilizes dark backgrounds with high-contrast accent colors and subtle strokes to create a depth-heavy, professional look that fits into any game environment without being distracting.
